# MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of handwritten digits, each labeled with the corresponding digit it represents. MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, referring to the organization that originally compiled the dataset.

## Overview
- **Number of Samples**: 70,000 images
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels
- **Data Type**: Grayscale images
- **Labeling**: Each image is labeled with the digit it represents (0 to 9)

## Usage
The MNIST dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models, particularly in the task of digit recognition. It serves as a fundamental dataset for learning and experimenting with different techniques in image classification and pattern recognition.
